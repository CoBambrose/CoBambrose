# Whatsup, World!

My name's Cobain Ambrose and I'm a self-taught web-developer like many others on this platform. I contribute to web development and video-game modding projects as well as managing my own repos. If you need help on a project or want to start something together, check out my skills and get in contact via my Instagram or Email.
